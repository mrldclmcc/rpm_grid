                <h3>Philosophy & Inspirations</h3>
                <p>The Functional Body Composition program is an 8-week initiative designed to develop physique and strength while incorporating functional fitness principles. The goal is to help you "look good, move well."</p>
                <p>It draws inspiration from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>German Body Composition (GBC):</strong> A methodology known for supersets, time under tension, and manipulating rest periods to intensify training. The program's author noted that when done correctly, the GBC method is "just about guaranteed to get you results."</li>
                    <li><strong>Functional Bodybuilding (FBB):</strong> Incorporates intelligent warmups and hybrid programs, dialing back intensity from pure CrossFit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mixed Modal Training:</strong> Uses principles from competitive CrossFit to enhance the metabolic impact of training and develop local muscle fatigue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The program aims to combine the efficacy of GBC for hypertrophy and fat loss with increased "functionality" by adding more variety and emphasizing quality movement, addressing the potential for monotony in traditional GBC.</p>

                <h3>Structure and Key Concepts for Success</h3>
                <p>The program follows a 7-day weekly calendar over 8 weeks. The optimal schedule is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Day 1 - Upper Pull + Lower Squat</li>
                    <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Day 2 - Upper Push + Lower Pull</li>
                    <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> REST - EASY ACTIVE RECOVERY</li>
                    <li><strong>Thursday:</strong> Day 3 - Upper Push and Pull</li>
                    <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Day 4 - Lower Body Squat and Pull</li>
                    <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Day 5 - Shoulders, Arms, Core + Intensity</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> REST - FULL REST DAY</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To succeed, it is crucial to follow a **Consistent Schedule**, **Honor the Tempo, Rest, and Supersets**, and **Load Wisely**. Avoid mixing programs and remember that "more is NOT always better." If you feel "trashed," a 1-week deload is recommended.</p>
                
                <h3>Loading - Choose Wisely</h3>
                <p>The program does not provide percentage guidelines from one-rep maxes. The common mistake is loading too heavy, which compromises form and tempo. Conversely, don't go too light. Aim for the top end of a rep range (e.g., 8 reps in an 6-8 rep range) with the heaviest weight you can control while maintaining proper form and tempo.</p>
                <p>Weeks 1 and 2 are "loading weeks" to find your weights. In Weeks 3-8, as rest periods shorten and volume increases, don't expect to make huge weight increases. Maintaining or making small increases is a sign of great progress. A properly loaded superset should feel challenging on the last few sets but allow you to remain in control throughout.</p>

            <h2 class="modal__title">Progressive Overload</h2>
            <div class="modal__body">
                <p>The program's progressive overload scheme is multifaceted, drawing on GBC principles to intensify training over the 8 weeks. The primary mechanisms of progression are:</p>
                <div class="modal__content-section">
                    <h3>Loading and Weight Progression</h3>
                    <p>Weeks 1 and 2 are "loading weeks" to find appropriate training weights. The goal is to choose weights that allow you to maintain good form and tempo while aiming for the top of the prescribed rep range. The program emphasizes that making huge weight increases is not the primary goal. As rest periods shorten and volume increases in Weeks 3-8, the focus is on maintaining the same loads or making only small increases, as the sets will become tougher due to the reduced rest and increased volume.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="modal__content-section">
                    <h3>Rest Period Progression</h3>
                    <p>This is a key mechanism of progressive overload. Rest periods between exercises in supersets are progressively shortened, making the same weights and tempos feel much harder.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 1 & 2:</strong> Core strength supersets include 75-second rest periods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 3 & 4:</strong> Rest periods are shortened to 60 seconds. The goal is to maintain or slightly increase loads.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 5 & 6:</strong> The number of sets for core supersets increases from 3 to 4, while rest periods remain at 60 seconds, adding significant volume.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 7 & 8:</strong> Rest periods are further shortened to 45 seconds, with 4 sets per superset, significantly increasing intensity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="modal__content-section">
                    <h3>Sets and Reps Progression</h3>
                    <p>The number of sets for core strength supersets increases from 3 to 4 starting in Week 5. The rep ranges for strength supersets generally remain consistent across weeks, with the challenge coming from the changes in rest and volume.</p>

            <h2 class="modal__title">Tempo Notation</h2>
            <div class="modal__body">
                <p>The strength portions of the workouts are precise and require exact tempos. Following the prescribed tempo is critical for success as it dictates the Time Under Tension (TUT) for the muscle, which is a key driver of muscle growth and strength. Rushing tempos is a common mistake that compromises form and defeats the purpose of the training method.</p>
                
                <h3>How to read Tempo Notation</h3>
                <p>The tempo is represented by a four-digit number, such as <strong>2110</strong>. Each digit corresponds to a specific phase of the lift, measured in seconds:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Digit:</strong> The eccentric (lowering) phase. For example, in a squat, this is the time it takes to descend into the squat. A `2` means 2 seconds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Digit:</strong> The isometric hold at the bottom of the movement. In a squat, this is the pause at the deepest point. A `1` means 1 second.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third Digit:</strong> The concentric (lifting) phase. In a squat, this is the time to stand back up. An `X` means explosive movement, as fast as possible. A `1` means 1 second.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fourth Digit:</strong> The isometric hold at the top of the movement. In a squat, this is the pause at the top before starting the next rep. A `0` means no pause.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, a tempo of <strong>31X0</strong> for a bench press means: 3 seconds to lower the bar to your chest, 1-second pause on the chest, an explosive drive up, and no pause at the top before starting the next rep.</p>

            <h2 class="modal__title">Diet & Nutrition</h2>
            <div class="modal__body">
                <p>To achieve optimal results, a strategic approach to diet and nutrition is emphasized as equally important as the training. Combining both is the most effective path to success. The program highlights that you will progress significantly more by closely manipulating your diet than by merely adding in more training.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Recommendations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fuel Properly:</strong> Avoid the pitfall of justifying poor nutritional choices by thinking you "earned it" in the gym. Proper fueling enhances energy, performance, and overall health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precision Nutrition Calculator:</strong> The program recommends utilizing the Precision Nutrition calculator to determine your specific nutritional requirements. Use "Muscle Gain" or "Body Recomposition" as your training goals and "INTENSE" for your activity level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meet Your Protein Goals:</strong> It is of paramount importance to meet your protein goals, especially given the significant volume of resistance training involved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Progress, Not Perfection:</strong> Perfection in nutrition is not required to achieve results; simply doing a little better than your current habits will suffice.</li>
