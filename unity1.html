            <p>The Unity program is a powerbuilding training program developed by John Meadows and Dave Tate, drawing on their decades of experience in both powerlifting and bodybuilding. The name "Unity" reflects the program's core goal of combining the disciplines of bodybuilding and powerlifting to achieve a worldwide conquest of muscular development and strength. It is designed to foster both physical strength and muscle growth, addressing areas like maximal motor unit recruitment, mechanical tension for hypertrophy, and rate of force development.</p>
            
            <h3>Program Structure</h3>
            <p>The Unity Powerbuilding Training Program is structured over <strong>9 weeks</strong>, divided into three blocks of three weeks each. The program follows a 5-day training split, with two full rest days at the end of the week:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Lower body focus with Dynamic speed sets.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Upper body push focus with Dynamic speed sets.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Upper body pull focus.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 4:</strong> Lower body focus with Max Effort work.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Upper body push focus with Max Effort work.</li>
                <li><strong>Days 6 & 7:</strong> OFF – Family Days.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The program emphasizes the importance of <strong>recovery</strong>, particularly after Days 4 and 5, which are noted as the hardest training days. Recommendations for recovery include specific nutrition (intra-workout amino, electrolyte, and carb drinks) and lifestyle adjustments (reducing stress, aiming for 5 full sleep cycles).</p>

        <div class="detail-screen__content">
            <p>The Unity program integrates various training methodologies to achieve its powerbuilding goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Foundation in Big 3 Lifts:</strong> The program uses the squat, bench press, and deadlift as its foundational movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Max Effort Work:</strong> This method involves working up to very heavy, lower repetition sets, aiming for personal records (PRs). This type of training is crucial for achieving maximal motor unit recruitment, which is the activation of the largest nerve cells controlling hundreds of muscle fibers, leading to increased strength and muscle fiber size.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Work:</strong> This involves using lighter weights, typically 55-75% of your 1-rep maximum, with a focus on explosive speed. The goal is to improve your rate of force development, making you more explosive and enabling you to push more weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Bodybuilding Method:</strong> This involves traditional bodybuilding techniques, often using loads around 75-85% of your 1-rep maximum, performed to failure or close to it. High-intensity techniques that push you beyond failure, such as drop sets or partials, are also incorporated.</li>
                <li><strong>Intensity Regulation (RPE):</strong> For exercises that are not percentage-based, the program utilizes the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale to guide intensity levels. RPE values range from 6.0 (fairly easy warm-up) to 13 (multiple high-intensity techniques/go apeshit set!), indicating how many reps are left "in the tank". Working sets are generally considered to be RPE 7.0 and above.</li>
                <li><strong>Feeder Sets:</strong> Crucial low-rep sets are used to gradually prepare your muscles for the heavier working sets, helping to prevent injury and premature exhaustion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="detail-screen__title">Progressive Overload</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-screen__content">
            <p>The program features <strong>very aggressive progressions</strong> from week to week, with all progressions clearly highlighted in bold type within the workout plans. While hitting every single progression is not explicitly expected, giving your maximum effort is crucial for success, as even achieving 25% of the progressions will lead to significant results.</p>
            <p>Progressive overload is implemented through various methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increasing Repetitions:</strong> Often, you are instructed to perform more reps with the <strong>same weight</strong> used in previous weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Weight:</strong> You will also be challenged to increase the weight on specific exercises while maintaining or increasing reps.</li>
                <li><strong>Adding Sets:</strong> The total number of work sets for certain exercises increases across weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Percentage of 1-Rep Max (1RM):</strong> For dynamic work, the percentage of your 1RM used gradually increases across the training blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementing Advanced Intensity Techniques:</strong> The program frequently incorporates or increases the intensity of techniques like partial reps, drop sets, cluster sets, and isoholds.</li>
                <li><strong>Decreasing Rest Periods:</strong> For some exercises, the rest time between sets is progressively reduced to increase density and intensity.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Movement Volume/Distance:</strong> For carries, the number of steps or distance is increased.</li>
                <li><strong>Slowing Down Tempo:</strong> For certain exercises, the progression is to slow down your tempo even more than the previous week.</li>
