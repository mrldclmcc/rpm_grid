                    title: 'Program Overview & Philosophy',
                    body: `
                        <p>Welcome to a paradigm shift in resistance training. This program challenges the conventional "blitz and rest" model of bodybuilding, where muscles are worked to exhaustion and then rested for 48-72 hours. Instead, we focus on <strong>high frequency and low volume</strong> to rapidly increase muscle density and what is known as "true muscle tone".</p>
                        <h4>The Philosophy</h4>
                        <p>The core principle is to condition your Central Nervous System (CNS) to fire more efficiently. By training muscle groups frequently with lower volume, you send constant signals to your CNS to improve its ability to recruit muscle fibers. This results in muscles that are harder and more defined, even in a relaxed state.</p>
                        <p>A key aspect of this routine is to <strong>avoid training to failure</strong>. Pushing to failure can send negative feedback to the CNS, hindering its ability to recover and adapt. The goal is to stimulate the muscle, not annihilate it. This allows for the high frequency of training that is central to the program's success.</p>
                        <h4>What to Expect Over 12 Weeks</h4>
                        <p>This program is an intensive 8-12 week "boot camp" designed to transform your physique. You will be training 4-6 days per week, alternating between two different types of workout days:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Explosive Days:</strong> Focused on lifting with maximum speed and force to generate a strong CNS surge.</li>
                            <li><strong>Time Under Tension (TUT) Days:</strong> Focused on slow, deliberate movements to maximize muscle density and tone with less joint stress.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By the end of the 12 weeks, you can expect significant improvements in strength, muscle definition, and density. This is not a year-round program; it's a specialized cycle to achieve a new level of conditioning, which can then be maintained with a less demanding routine.</p>
                    `
                },
                progression: {
                    title: 'Progression & Progressive Overload',
                    body: `
                        <p>Progression in this routine is different from traditional bodybuilding where the main goal is to constantly increase weight. Here, we focus on improving the efficiency of your Central Nervous System (CNS) and your ability to generate muscular tension.</p>
                        <h4>Progression on Explosive Days</h4>
                        <p>The primary goal is not just lifting heavier, but lifting the same weight <strong>faster and with more force</strong>. This is a sign that your CNS is becoming more efficient. You are progressing when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The weight feels noticeably lighter than it did before.</li>
                            <li>You can move the weight with greater speed and acceleration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Only consider increasing the weight when the current weight feels easy for your target reps. Make <strong>small, infrequent jumps</strong> in weight. Forcing big jumps too soon will lead to fatigue and hinder CNS adaptation. Remember, the goal is a positive feedback loop, not a struggle.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Progression on TUT Days</h4>
                        <p>Progression here is about mastering the skill of <strong>"Irradiation"</strong>—generating maximum tension. The goal is to increase your ability to create a powerful mind-muscle connection.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focus on making even light weights feel heavy by squeezing the target muscle and surrounding muscles as hard as possible throughout the entire lift.</li>
                            <li>You are progressing when you can generate more tension with the same weight.</li>
                            <li>Only increase the weight if you can maintain this maximum tension. Prioritize the quality of the contraction over the amount of weight lifted.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>How to Track Progress</h4>
                        <p>Since progression isn't just about the numbers on the weights, tracking requires a different approach:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Pay attention to how the lifts feel. A workout journal can be helpful to note when a weight on an Explosive Day starts to feel lighter or faster. For TUT days, note the quality of the tension you can generate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fat Loss:</strong> For tangible results, track your body composition. Weigh yourself at the same time each morning and, if possible, take skinfold measurements with calipers. Aim to hit a new personal low in either weight or skinfold measurement each week. This provides immediate feedback on your progress.</li>
                        </ul>
                    `
                },
                diet: {
                    title: 'The Hybrid Diet Plan',
                    body: `
                        <p>This program recommends a "hybrid diet" that strategically uses carbohydrates to your advantage, keeping your metabolism high while promoting fat loss. The approach involves low-carb intake during the day and targeted carb consumption at night, particularly after workouts.</p>
                        <h4>The Strategy</h4>
                        <p>By keeping carbs low during the day, your body is encouraged to use fat for fuel. Then, by consuming carbs after your evening workout, you replenish muscle glycogen stores, which keeps your metabolism revving and prevents the metabolic slowdown that can occur on long-term low-carb diets. This strategic carb intake ensures that the carbs are primarily used by your muscles rather than being stored as body fat.</p>
                        <h4>Calorie Tracking Guideline</h4>
                        <p>To get started with your daily calorie intake, you can use the following formula as a baseline. Remember to adjust based on your progress and how you feel.</p>
                        <p><strong>Goal Weight in Pounds x (Hours working out per week + 9.5) = Daily Calorie Target</strong></p>
                        <p>For example, if your goal weight is 180 lbs and you work out 5 hours per week:</p>
                        <p>180 x (5 + 9.5) = 180 x 14.5 = 2,610 calories per day.</p>
                        <p>This is a starting point. Monitor your progress and adjust your intake as needed.</p>
                    `
                },
                cardio: {
                    title: 'Cardio for Fat Loss',
                    body: `
                        <p>Cardio is a crucial component of this program, performed <strong>after</strong> resistance training. Its purpose is to deplete muscle glycogen and burn additional calories, which is essential for revealing the muscle definition you are building.</p>
                        <h4>Option 1: Limited Time (15 Minutes)</h4>
                        <p>If you're short on time, you have two effective options:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):</strong> Alternate 30 seconds of all-out effort with 30 seconds of easy recovery for 15 minutes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Steady-State Cardio:</strong> Maintain a challenging but sustainable pace for the full 15 minutes. You should feel a slight burn in the working muscles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Option 2: Ample Time (30 Minutes)</h4>
                        <p>If you have more time, you can enhance the fat-burning effect:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>HIIT + Moderate Cardio:</strong> Perform a 15-minute HIIT session, followed immediately by 15 minutes of moderate-intensity steady-state cardio.</li>
                            <li><strong>Steady-State Cardio:</strong> Perform 30 minutes of steady-state cardio at a pace that creates a slight, consistent burn in your muscles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The key is consistency. Performing cardio after your lifts ensures that you tap into fat stores for energy more effectively.</p>
