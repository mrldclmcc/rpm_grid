                <h2>Program Philosophy: The Novice's Path</h2>
                <p>
                    The "Baby Groot" program is a 12-week hypertrophy routine designed by John Meadows specifically for new lifters (with 1 year or less of experience). The goal is to build a solid foundation by focusing on frequency, progressive overload, and proper mind-muscle connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike many programs that train a muscle once a week, this split hits each muscle group 2-3 times per week to maximize growth. The key is to train hard but smart. Meadows believes that training a muscle every 2-3 days is optimal to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and avoid losing out on gains.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>The 12-Week Progression</h3>
                <p>The program follows a 3-day split, alternating weekly between a primary "A" set of workouts and a "B" set. This ensures you are constantly challenging your muscles from different angles and with different movements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11:</strong> Perform workouts "Upper A," "Lower A," "Full A".</li>
                    <li><strong>Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12:</strong> Perform workouts "Upper B," "Lower B," "Full B".</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Progression Goals</h3>
                <p>This is the most important part of the program. You must strive to get stronger or do more reps over time. Do not just go through the motions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Compound Lifts:</strong> Aim to add <strong>30-60 lbs</strong> to your starting weights (e.g., Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press) by the end of 12 weeks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Isolation Lifts:</strong> Aim to add <strong>6 additional reps</strong> to your starting rep range (e.g., Curls, Tricep Extensions) by the end of 12 weeks.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Understanding RPE</h3>
                <p>RPE stands for **Rate of Perceived Exertion**. It's a way to measure how hard you're working. Meadows designed this program with RPE in mind to prevent overtraining and ensure you're lifting with intent. For a beginner, it is not necessary to go to failure.</p>
                <p><strong>RPE 8:</strong> You could do 2-3 more reps. This is the sweet spot for most sets, stimulating growth without burning you out. Meadows recommends an RPE of 8 for your compound lifts.</p>
                <p><strong>RPE 8.5:</strong> You have 2 more reps left in the tank. Meadows recommends this RPE for isolation exercises, as they tend to allow for less form breakdown and are thus safer to push a little harder.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Diet, Nutrition, and Rest</h3>
                <p>For optimal results and recovery, it's crucial to focus on diet and rest. The program emphasizes the concept of Net Protein Balance, which is a scale between Muscle Protein Synthesis (building muscle) and Muscle Protein Breakdown (breaking down muscle).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diet and Nutrition:</strong> To stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis, consume a diet with adequate calories and protein. Eating enough carbohydrates can help manage Muscle Protein Breakdown. The goal is to maintain a positive net protein balance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rest and Recovery:</strong> You must be recovered to train effectively. The program suggests training a muscle group 2-3 times per week, as Muscle Protein Synthesis is stimulated for about 48 hours after a workout. If you are still feeling sore, your muscle fibers have not fully recovered, and you should not train that muscle group to avoid overtraining. The program is designed with a lower number of sets and moderate intensity to help maximize this recovery.</li>
