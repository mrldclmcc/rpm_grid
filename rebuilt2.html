                    <p>Thank you for purchasing Rebuilt 2.0. You've made a great decision!</p>
                    <p>On October 9, 2020, Joe DeFranco had major shoulder surgery. (This was his 4th major surgery, as he had 3 back surgeries in his 20's to remove a tumor that was growing inside his sacrum.) This time around, his supraspinatus & biceps tendons were completely torn, along with his infraspinatus, subscapularis and labrum. These tears/injuries were a culmination of 35 years of heavy lifting, combined with 13 years of playing football.</p>
                    <p>The DAY Joe arrived home from his surgery, he began planning, researching and designing ReBuilt 2.0. It's been a long road... and it certainly wasn't easy. But here we are - 14 months post-surgery - and he's in the best shape of his life [at 46-years-old]!</p>
                    <p>Most people accept joint pain as part of the muscle-building & strength-building process, but it doesn't have to be that way! ReBuilt 2.0 uses the most joint-friendly exercises - in the proper sequencing - to reduce joint stress, while increasing strength, hypertrophy & mobility!</p>
                    <p>As you can see from Joe's pics, ReBuilt 2.0 has built him the best physique of his life - and the best part is - he actually feels better than he looks. Now it's YOUR turn!</p>
                    <p>If you're like Joe and have nagging injuries (from playing sports when you were younger and/or years of heavy lifting), ReBuilt 2.0 is about to change your life! Gone are the days when training would take away from your quality of life. It's time to build a physique that enhances your daily activities and feels as good as it looks... It's time to get REBUILT!</p>

                    <h4>1. Exercise Execution</h4>
                    <p>Make sure to watch the VIDEO DEMOS of each exercise before you begin this program! We filmed every single exercise in this program for you. Take advantage of the video library and review each exercise before you begin each workout. Proper exercise execution is key if you're interested in maximizing your results!</p>

                    <h4>2. Training Days | Program Split Recommendation</h4>
                    <p>Recommended Split:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Push</li>
                        <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Legs</li>
                        <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Off</li>
                        <li><strong>Thursday:</strong> Pull</li>
                        <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Off</li>
                        <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Full Body</li>
                        <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Off</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you prefer/need weekends off, simply perform your Full Body workout on Friday. (Of all the body parts, I believe "upper back" can handle the most volume/frequency. After all, they are postural muscles which "fight gravity" 24/7 so training 'Back' on "back-to-back" days (pun intended) is NOT the end of the world :)</p>

                    <h4>3. RPE for “Pump-n-Prime" circuits</h4>
                    <p>You will see "RPE 5-7" written next to all the "Pump-n-Prime" circuits. This is merely a reminder to not go "too crazy" (weight-wise) on these exercises. Think of this circuit as the final phase of your WARM-UP. Your main goal(s) are to bring some blood to the primary & supporting muscles (which helps provide some additional stability once we get into the heavier, more intense exercises), improve mobility/ROM & prime ("wake up") your CNS. You do NOT want to go to failure (or anywhere near failure) on these sets. These circuits have been placed at the beginning of each session to ENHANCE the subsequent workout, not take away from it.</p>

                    <h4>4. "Total Reps" Explanation</h4>
                    <p>For your Main Lift (on PUSH Day) during Weeks 1-4 you'll be performing "40 total reps w/ your 10-15RM"... Don't worry about figuring out percentages of your "1RM" for the 'Slight Decline DB Pause Bench Press'. Simply choose a weight that you know you can complete for 10 reps, but not more than 15 reps. THAT'S the weight you'll be using for all sets. (Simple enough for ya?!)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you happen to get over 15 reps on the first set, no problem... Simply go 5-10lbs heavier during the following week's workout.</li>
                        <li>On the other hand, if you couldn't complete 10 reps on the first set, you went too heavy. In that case you'll need to drop the weight. You'll figure it out :)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you choose an appropriate weight, your "week-to-week" goal is to try and complete your total reps in less time each week. (Your ability to complete the 40 reps in less time should be a product of shorter rest intervals between sets, NOT because you're "rushing" through the actual reps!) REMEMBER to pause for a second at the bottom of each & every rep!</p>

                    <h4>5. "OFF DAY" Recommendations [VERY IMPORTANT]</h4>
                    <p>I recommend taking a minimum of 10-12k total steps every day. (That seems to be the "sweet spot" where most of the health/longevity benefits begin.) Personally, for my ReBuilt 2.0 transformation I walked 30-40 minutes "every" morning. (NOTE: My goal was to walk every morning, but I averaged 6 days a week, never less than 5 days.) Every night, after dinner, I also walked our dogs for 10-20 minutes. (I highly recommend taking a 10+ minute walk after each and every meal, whenever possible. This helps improve digestion, while reducing gas & bloating.) On days that I missed one or more of my walks, I simply "added extra steps" onto another (less busy) day later in the week. Your “big picture” goal is to get at least 70-85k total steps in each week; Figure out the most convenient/consistent way to get those steps in [based on YOUR schedule] and make it happen!</p>
                    <p>I personally didn’t do any other “cardio”, besides my daily morning/evening walks, while on the ReBuilt 2.0 program. But, if you’d like to incorporate a little extra cardio (besides walking) into this program, I’d recommend 1 HIIT session a week. Just make sure you’re doing it properly!</p>
                    <p>Here’s my HIIT recommendation: 10sec of ALL-OUT effort followed by 50sec of active recovery. Do this for 8-12 rounds with a 2-3 min warm-up & cool down. (Assault bike, rower or sled/prowler are some of my favorite choices for HIIT sessions.)</p>

                    <h4>6. Rest Intervals</h4>
                    <p>If a specific rest interval isn’t specified for an exercise, rest as long/little as you feel you need to perform the next set at the highest possible level. (Everyone has different strength/conditioning levels, so work at a pace that’s appropriate for YOU.) BUT, with that being said, don’t get in a habit of resting 3-4 minutes between every set! REMEMBER: We’re prioritizing health, longevity & relative strength on this program - so your goal should be to “push the pace” of your workouts (without sacrificing the quality of your reps/sets).</p>

                    <h4>7. Weekly Progress [supplemental & accessory exercises]</h4>
                    <p>“Progress” can come in many different forms: You can lift more weight each week, decrease your rest intervals (while lifting the same weight), improve your technique, increase the number of reps (with the same weight), etc. Make sure you’re doing everything in your power to progress from week-to-week. Don’t just “go through the motions”!</p>
                    <p>FOR EXAMPLE: If an exercise calls for “3 sets of 12-15 reps” [during one of the 4-week training blocks] you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>OPTION A:</strong> Perform 3 sets of 15 reps during the first week, then increase the weight and decrease the reps the following week(s).</li>
                        <li><strong>OPTION B:</strong> Perform 3 sets of 12 during the first week, then try and increase the reps [while using the same or more weight] the following week(s).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are just 2 examples of the many ways you can progress from week-to-week. I don’t care how you decide to progress your supplemental & accessory exercises, as long as you’re progressing!</p>

                    <h4>8. Exercise Substitutions</h4>
                    <p>If an exercise hurts, DON’T DO IT! (See “Training Longevity Commandment #1”). There is always an alternative/regression, so there’s no need to “push through pain”. You must become your own best trainer/coach. Just because an exercise/regression may not be programmed in any of the ReBuilt 2.0 workouts doesn’t mean you can’t incorporate it. If there’s a variation of a movement that you feel is better for you and your body, DO IT! Again, I want you to become your own best trainer/coach. Nobody knows how your body feels better than you. Be smart and make any programming adjustments that you feel are needed to personalize the ReBuilt 2.0 program for your body.</p>

                    <h4>9. Equipment Requirements</h4>
                    <p>The majority of the ReBuilt 2.0 program requires only basic equipment that most commercial (or well-equipped home) gyms have: Rack, Adjustable Bench, Dumbbells, Barbell, Bands & Rings/suspension trainer. Cables are also incorporated into the program, but most of the cable exercises can be substituted with band(s) if needed.</p>
