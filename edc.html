            "details": "The EVERY.DAY.CARRY. (EDC) Program is a comprehensive fitness regimen designed to enhance every aspect of your life by building true functional strength, conditioning, and athleticism. The name has a dual meaning: you will consistently carry heavy, awkward objects, and you will carry the strength gained into your everyday life. This program is for those who want to be strong, athletic, lean, well-conditioned, and injury-resistant. It's not just about lifting in the gym but about applying that strength to real-world challenges, making you an asset rather than a liability. It benefits both the average lifter seeking a new challenge and 'Warrior Athletes' (MMA fighters, military, first responders) who need to manipulate heavy, uncooperative objects or bodies in high-stakes situations. The program builds a bigger 'engine' for whatever your life demands."

            "summary": "Guidance on cardio, conditioning, and weighted carries.",
            "details": "Cardio in the EDC Program is integrated through two main avenues. Firstly, the core weighted carries are incredibly demanding on your heart and lungs. Carrying heavy, awkward objects requires significant oxygen, building immense cardiovascular conditioning and work capacity. This improves foot speed, agility, and balance. Secondly, the program includes optional bodyweight conditioning sessions. These are designed to further challenge your lungs or serve as active recovery without hindering your strength gains. They use high-intensity formats like EMOMs, AMRAPs, and ladders with exercises like burpees, squats, push-ups, sprints, and animal walks. This dual approach ensures you build a powerful cardiovascular system that supports both strength and real-world functional fitness."

            "details": "Proper nutrition and recovery are at least 50% of your results in this demanding program. A poor diet will not provide the fuel needed for these intense sessions, leading to poor results or injury. You don't need to be a 'food Nazi,' but every meal should be a conscious choice that moves you closer to your goals. Think of food as fuel for performance. Recovery is equally critical. You will experience soreness in new ways as you use muscles you may have never trained before. It is vital to get adequate sleep, stay hydrated, and dedicate 30-60 minutes daily to active recovery. This can include stretching, foam rolling, yoga, meditation, or cold plunges. Living like an athlete means prioritizing these practices over distractions like social media. Your choices today determine the person you become."

          "progressiveOverload": {
            "title": "Progressive Overload Scheme",
            "summary": "Principles of progression for strength and carries.",
            "details": "Progression is key. For weighted carries, a 1-Rep Max (1RM) is the most weight you can carry for 50 feet without dropping it. While percentage-based training is an option, a linear approach is often better for beginners to carries, as gains come quickly. The program uses HEAVY, MEDIUM, and LIGHT intensities. HEAVY carries are for short distances (~50ft) with loads over 70% of your 1RM. MEDIUM carries are for moderate distances (~100ft) with loads of 55%-70% 1RM. LIGHT carries are for long distances (150ft+) with lighter loads. For strength work, you will work up to a top set for a prescribed rep range each day in a Giant Set format. Always strive to lift as heavy as possible for the given reps without failing. The prescribed rounds are your 'working sets' and do not include warm-ups. Continue adding weight each round until you hit your top set for the day."
